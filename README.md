# woody-puzzel

_pronounced "wood-ee puh-ZELL"_

**woody-puzzel** is a command-line clone of the popular mobile game
[Woody Puzzle][]. It's also a platform for building and testing machine
learning algorithms that play the game.

At least, that's what we *want* it to be. Right now, it's just an idea and some
code.

## Installation

 1. Clone this repo. `git clone https://github.com/loboyd/woody-puzzel.git`
 2. (*optional*) Set up a [virtual environment][].
 3. Install dependencies. `cd woody-puzzel; pip install -r requirements.txt`
 4. Run the game. `./woody-puzzel.py`

## Tests

**woody-puzzel** uses Python's built-in `unittest` test runner. To run tests:

cd woody-puzzel
python -m unittest
```

Or, to run tests and also generate a test coverage report, run:

```

coverage html
```

and then navigate to `./htmlcov/index.html` to view the report.
